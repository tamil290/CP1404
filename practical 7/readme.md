## Clean Code Lessons

1. Clarity and maintainability are crucial aspects of writing code that is easy to comprehend, 
update, and maintain. To enhance readability, it's important to adhere to consistent naming conventions, maintain proper indentation, and avoid complex or nested structures.

2. Modularizing code into separate functions and classes enhances reusability and comprehension. Each 
function or class should have a specific responsibility, leading to better organization and reducing the risk of introducing errors during changes.

3. Properly anticipating and handling errors is a vital component of creating clean code. Ensuring
proper validation of user inputs, checking for edge cases, and providing meaningful error messages can greatly improve the user experience and enhance the robustness of the software.
