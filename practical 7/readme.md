## Introduction

The repository contains my practical work for the CP1404 programming subject. 
My name is [TAMILSELVAN ], and I am a studying at [James Cook University Singapore].

## Clean Code Lessons

1. Readability and maintainability: Writing clean, well-organized code is essential for making it easy
to understand, modify, and maintain. Using consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, 
and avoiding overly complex or nested structures enhances readability.

2. Modularity: Breaking code into separate functions and classes makes it more reusable and
easier to understand. Each function or class should have a single responsibility, which leads
to better organization and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs when making changes.

3. Error handling and input validation: Anticipating and handling errors is crucial in clean code.
Properly validating user inputs, checking for exceptional cases, and providing meaningful 
error messages can greatly improve the user experience and make the software more robust.
