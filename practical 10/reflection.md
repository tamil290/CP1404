## Predictions for Practical Assignments

In hindsight, this experience underscored the crucial nature of contingency planning in project management. 
It reminded me that any task, no matter how straightforward it may initially seem, comes with its share of 
unexpected detours. These obstacles are not necessarily a sign of failure or inadequacy, but rather an integral 
part of the process of exploration and learning. As I continue to undertake more tasks in the future, 
I am optimistic that these experiences will allow me to improve my time estimation skills, better anticipate 
potential hurdles, and develop a more accurate and realistic project schedule.

## Reviews for the code

 I experienced personal evolution in ways that took me by surprise. It took me towards refining my perceptiveness
 and expanding my understanding of effective programming methodologies. There were instances when the process 
 seemed somewhat demanding, as it necessitated keeping pace with contemporary coding norms, standards, and 
 architectural designs. Despite the demanding nature, it also inspired a sense of fulfillment.

## Tasks

More Real-life Scenarios: Incorporate more tasks that mimic real-life scenarios to provide 
students with practical experience and to better prepare them for future professional work.

Group Project: Implement a group project that integrates various concepts learned throughout 
the course. This project would emphasize teamwork and the importance of efficient communication in a software development setting.
