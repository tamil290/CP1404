## Predictions for Practical Assignments

Looking back on the early stages of the practical tasks, I must confess that my predictions on time
requirements were not always on the mark. In many instances, I found myself underestimating the 
time required due to surprise hurdles and complexities that cropped up during the execution phase.
This mismatch between my estimates and actual time taken felt a bit frustrating and 
daunting initially.

## Reviews for the code

Engaging in code reviews has been an enlightening journey, filled with a spectrum of emotions, 
learning and growth from both perspectives.

Wearing the hat of a reviewer, I found myself evolving in unexpected ways. It pushed me to hone 
my attention to detail and deepen my comprehension of optimal coding techniques. It felt a bit 
challenging at times, as it compelled me to stay in sync with the latest coding trends, 
conventions, and design patterns. However, the challenge also brought a sense of accomplishment. 


## Tasks

More Real-life Scenarios: Incorporate more tasks that mimic real-life scenarios to provide 
students with practical experience and to better prepare them for future professional work.

Group Project: Implement a group project that integrates various concepts learned throughout 
the course. This project would emphasize teamwork and the importance of efficient communication in a software development setting.
